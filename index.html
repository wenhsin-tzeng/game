          <p>The world inside is just exciting as the one outside! Quick Eye is a game for kids and grownups that allows you to use your imagination and notice your surroundings. Even if you can’t physically meet with new friends outside, you can still get to know each other.</p>

            <p>Shuffle the cards and place them face down. Decide who goes first with a game of rock, paper, scissor; the winner goes first. First player turns over the top card from the deck. Read out the word and explain the meaning to any younger players. Every player needs to look for a noun (name or object) - which you would associate with the word on the card as fast as possible. Use the environment around you for inspiration. The first person who hits the bell after finding the “noun” wins, and this round ends. Next player opens the next card and repeat the process again. The game goes on until the time (10 mins) hits.</p>

          <p>The winner of each round gets to take the card from the pile and add it to his/her deck. In the end, the player who ends up with the most cards after 10 mins wins. Likewise, the player with the least amound of cards in his/her deck loses.</p>
          <div class="rulestitle">Plot/Conditions For Play</div>
          <p>Anywhere is fine. You can play at home, in the car, outdoors, on your way to school, when visiting friends or queuing at shops. Looking for objects that fit the adjectives becomes even more interesting if you change the location.</p>
